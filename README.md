# AetherGo_CarbonFoortPrint_Optimization_In_Logestics
Optimize the route through ML model for optimizing the carbon foot print on the basis of distance, fuel, cargo weight and present weather conditions etc. 

## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to reduce the environmental impact of logistics operations by optimizing delivery routes based on **carbon emissions** rather than just cost or time. It leverages a **Random Forest machine learning model** trained on multi-factor data such as fuel usage, traffic, cargo weight, and weather conditions to recommend the most environmentally efficient routes.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Develop a model to predict carbon emissions for various delivery route scenarios.
- Recommend delivery routes that minimize carbon emissions.
- Provide a decision-support tool for logistics companies to adopt greener transportation practices.

## 🧠 Model Highlights

- **Model Type**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Why Random Forest?**
  - Handles multi-dimensional and non-linear data well.
  - Robust to outliers and noisy real-world data.
  - Provides feature importance for interpretability.
  - Requires minimal data preprocessing.

## 📊 Features Used
- Route distance and geometry
- Vehicle fuel consumption rate
- Real-time and historical weather data
- Traffic congestion levels
- Cargo type and weight
- Estimated delivery time
